🛠️ Project/Topic: Python `if-else` Practice – Simple Name Checker

---

## ✅ What I Did Today

- Practiced `if-else` statements in Python  
- Created a program to greet specific users based on input

---

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to use `if` and `else` for condition checking  
- Importance of proper indentation in Python  
- How Python compares strings (case-sensitive)

---

## 🔧 Code Example

```python
myName = input("What's your name?: ")
if myName == "David":
    print("Welcome Dude!")
    print("You're just the baldest dude I've ever seen")
else:
    print("Who on earth are you?!")
```

## 🖥️ Output

### Case 1: Input is **David**

```
What's your name?: David
Welcome Dude!
You're just the baldest dude I've ever seen
```

### Case 2: Input is **Pruthvi**

```
What's your name?: Pruthvi
Who on earth are you?!
```

## 😓 Challenges

- Remembering Python indentation rules  
- Understanding how string comparison works

---

## 🎯 Goals for Tomorrow

- Learn about nested `if` statements  
- Create a "True Fan" quiz game

---

## 💬 Reflection
