# 🗓️ Day 10 / 100 – 100 Days of Code

## 📅 Date: 2025-08-04  
## 🛠️ Project/Topic: Python – Arithmetic Operators

---

## ✅ What I Did Today

- Practiced all basic **arithmetic operations** in Python
- Understood the use of **floor division** (`//`) and **modulus** (`%`)
- Observed the difference between **normal division (`/`)** and **integer division**

---

## 💡 What I Learned

### ➗ **Python Arithmetic Operators**

| Operation       | Symbol | Description                          | Example        | Output |
|----------------|--------|--------------------------------------|----------------|--------|
| Addition        | `+`    | Adds values                          | `4 + 3`        | `7`    |
| Subtraction     | `-`    | Subtracts values                     | `8 - 9`        | `-1`   |
| Multiplication  | `*`    | Multiplies values                    | `4 * 32`       | `128`  |
| Division        | `/`    | Divides and returns float            | `50 / 5`       | `10.0` |
| Exponentiation  | `**`   | Raises to the power                  | `5 ** 2`       | `25`   |
| Modulus         | `%`    | Remainder of division                | `15 % 4`       | `3`    |
| Floor Division  | `//`   | Whole number division (no decimals)  | `15 // 2`      | `7`    |

## 🔧 Code Practiced Today

```python
adding = 4 + 3
print(adding)           # Output: 7

subtraction = 8 - 9
print(subtraction)      # Output: -1

multiplication = 4 * 32
print(multiplication)   # Output: 128

division = 50 / 5
print(division)         # Output: 10.0

squared = 5**2
print(squared)          # Output: 25

modulo = 15 % 4
print(modulo)           # Output: 3

divisor = 15 // 2
print(divisor)          # Output: 7
```

## 🤔 Why It Matters

- These are the **foundation of all numerical logic**
- Helps in **calculations, games, scoreboards, finance apps**, and more
- Essential for upcoming **conditional statements** and **loops**

---

## 😓 Challenges

- Floor division vs normal division: understanding `//` vs `/`
- Remembering to test modulus on different values

---

## 🎯 Goals for Tomorrow

- Learn **loops** (`for` and `while`)
- Start with **pattern printing** or **basic automation**

---

## 💬 Reflection

> Felt confident doing math in Python today!  
> Arithmetic operators are simple yet super powerful in real-world programming. 🧮  
> Looking forward to applying this in loops and logic flow next!
