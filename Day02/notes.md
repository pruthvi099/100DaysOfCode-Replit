- Store the input in variables

## 💡 What I Learned

- Take input from user and store in variables:
  ```python
    myName = input("What is your name? : ")
    myAge = input("What is your age? : ")
    replit = input("Do you like Replit? : ")
    print("OF COURSE YOU DO!")


    print("SO, YOU ARE ")
    print(myName)
    print("You are  ")
    print(myAge)
    print("And you like Replit ")
    print(replit)
  
    #Output :
    #What is your name? : Pruthvi      
    #What is your age? : 25
    #Do you like Replit? : Yes
    #OF COURSE YOU DO!
    #SO, YOU ARE 
    #Pruthvi
    #You are  
    #25 
    #And you like Replit 
    #Yes


  ```
