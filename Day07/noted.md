# Day 7 – 100DaysOfCode

🗕️ **Date:** 2025-07-15
🛠️ **Project/Topic:** Python `if-else` & Nested `if` – TV Show Fun Program

---

## ✅ What I Did Today

* Created a **nested `if` statement program** to ask the user about their favorite TV show and favorite character.
* Practiced **multi-level conditions** using simple user input.

---

## 💡 What I Learned

* How to use **nested `if` statements** inside another `if` block.
* Handling **multiple outcomes** depending on different user inputs.
* Practiced basic **input(), print()**, and string comparisons.

---

## 🔧 Code Example

```python
tvShow = input("What is your favorite tv show? ")
if tvShow == "peppa pig":
    print("Ugh, why?")
    faveCharacter = input("Who is your favorite character? ")
    if faveCharacter == "daddy pig":
        print("Right answer")
    else:
        print("Nah, Daddy Pig's the greatest")
elif tvShow == "paw patrol":
    print("Aww, sad times")
else:
    print("Yeah, that's cool and all…")
```

---

## 💻 Output Example

```
What is your favorite tv show? peppa pig
Ugh, why?
Who is your favorite character? pig
Nah, Daddy Pig's the greatest
```

---

## 😓 Challenges

* Making sure **nested `if` statements** are properly indented.
* Ensuring the program handles **different user inputs**.

---

## 🌟 Goals for Tomorrow

* Build a **Number Guessing Game** using **`while` loops** and **random numbers**.
* Learn about **loop control** with `break` and `continue`.

---

## 💬 Reflection

> Today I learned how to use **nested `if` statements** to make interactive text-based programs.
> Looking forward to learning loops next! 🌟
