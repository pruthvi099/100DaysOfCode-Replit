## ðŸ“… Day 16 / 100 â€“ While Loops (Continue or Exit Program)

### ðŸš€ Challenge of the Day:
Learned how to use **while loops** to keep a program running until the user decides to exit.  
Created a simple program that asks the user if they want to continue, and only stops when they type `n`.

---

### ðŸ’» Code Written:

```python
while True:
    answer = input("Do you want to continue? (y/n): ").strip().lower()
    if answer == "n":
        print("ðŸ‘‹ Goodbye!")
        break  # exits the loop
    else:
        print("ðŸš€ Let's keep going!")
```

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Example Output:

```
Do you want to continue? (y/n): y
ðŸš€ Let's keep going!
Do you want to continue? (y/n): y
ðŸš€ Let's keep going!
Do you want to continue? (y/n): n
ðŸ‘‹ Goodbye!
```

### âœ… Win of the Day:
- Practiced **infinite loops** with `while True`
- Learned how to **break out of loops**
- Made my program feel interactive ðŸ”„

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Goal:
Use `while` loops to build a **guessing game** with attempts counter! ðŸŽ®
