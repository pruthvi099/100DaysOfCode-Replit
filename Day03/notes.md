## 💡 What I Learned

-Concatenate with variables
  ```python
   myName = input("What's your name? ")
   myLunch = input("What are you having for lunch? ")
   print(myName, "is going to be chowing down on", myLunch, "very soon!")

   # Output :
   #What's your name? Pruthvi
  #What are you having for lunch? Rice Dal
  #Pruthvi is going to be chowing down on Rice Dal very soon!


  ```
